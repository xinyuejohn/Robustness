# Robustness

## Part 1: Creating adversarial examples
- trained a basic convolutional neural network on MNIST and craft adversarial examples via gradient descent

## Part 2: Adversarial training
- performed advcersarial training on the convolutional neural network from Part 1

## Part 3: Randomized smoothing training
- trained a smooth classifier via the principle of randomized smoothing

## Part 4: Randomized smoothing certification
- compared the robustness of the classifiers from Parts 1-3 via randomized smoothing
